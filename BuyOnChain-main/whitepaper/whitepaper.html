    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        BuyOnChain is a non-custodial protocol that permits users to buy and sell
        products or services through a decentralised platform that connects on-chain and off-
        chain. The protocol wants to create a safe marketplace for products and services. We
        also want to only require the minimum of information to guarantee safety for users.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Marketplaces on the internet like Amazon, Facebook Marketplace or Fiverr for
        services have millions of users every day. They act as middlemen between sellers and
        buyers and take a percentage of each transaction.<br>
        For example, Amazon takes 8% to 15% on each product sale. Moreover, sellers
        don't receive the payment of their work instantly, they're paid every 15 days, like if
        Amazon was their employer. For Fiverr, the platform charges you 2$ for every
        transaction under 50$ (including tips). All other payments are charged by 5.5%.
        People are losing at least 5% of their profits. The protocol is a non-custodial
        platform, that means there is no fee.
    </p>

    <h2>A Decentralised marketplace</h2>
    <p>
        As a decentralised marketplace, BuyOnChain doesn't act as a middle-man who
        charges fees for his own profits. It will be a platform that connects buyers and sellers
        and guarantees safety for every exchange.<br>
        We are also having our native token OnChain(BUY) and if the buyer chooses to use our native currency
        to make transaction, they will get certain incentives. Each user has to stake a certain 
        amount of our native token that will be added to an insurance pool, which will be used by the protocol
        in cases where a refund will be needed. These tokens are here to prevent spam and to make sure that sellers aren't
        here to sell fake products to customers as well as the buyer doesn't play wrong, in case 
        of scams this stake can be liquidated to refund buyers/sellers. These funds can be withdrawn 
        at any time until the seller or buyer doesn't have any transaction in process.  
        These funds will also generate yield during the staking period.
        To be able to sell products on the platform, sellers need to add their mail
        address and connect with an Ethereum wallet. The buyer also has to provide their delivery 
        address before purchase of any products.
    </p>

    <h2>Protocols mecanisms</h2>
    <p>
        
       
        <b>Sellers</b> can list their products on the platform. They receive a notification from the
        contract that represents their listed product (Proof of Listing). Anyone can
        see every listed product, when someone buys one (or some) product, the seller
        receives a mail to inform him that somebody bought his product and all shipping
        information. Seller did not receive the payment directly, it's stored on the contract
        until the buyer receives the product, the contract is the escrow. Seller now have
        buyer's information (address and names for delivery) and can ship the buyer's
        product. Then the seller had to send the tracking number to oracle (this can be done
        directly on the dashboard), also the notification (Proof of Listing) is changed by a new 
        (Proof of Shipping). Once the package is shipped to the buyer's address, buyer needs
        to confirm they received the package to allow seller to claim the payment. After the
        payment is processed, two ERC-1155 NFT (Proof of buying/selling) gets minted. These NFTs will contain all the 
        information regarding that transaction. One of the NFT will go to the buyer's address and
        the other to the seller's address. These NFTs will give access to buyers and sellers to give ratings 
        and reviews about the products and services.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Buyers</b> can browse every product listed on the platform. When they buy a
        product, the buyer needs to add his address and name for delivery. These
        informations are stored on IPFS and only available to the seller after the purchase. The payment can be
        done with any ERC-20 token(price*quantity). Then the buyer receives a notification that represents his
        purchase (Proof of Buying). On the other side, seller receive the information that
        someone placed an order and information for shipping. The seller can either accept the order or reject it.
        In case of rejection the amount that is paid by the buyer in the contract will automatically go back to him/her.

    <h2>Rating system</h2>
    <p>The rating system of the platform will be very important. It will work with the
        NFTs that sellers and buyers receive. The seller's NFT "Proof of Delivered" will allow
        sellers to be rated, but to be allowed to rate, buyers need to have the NFT "receipt".
        With this system, both sellers and buyers can be rated.
        The rating system will provide important informations on sellers and products.
        To make the buyer's rate benefit for them, they will be rewarded by a cashback in our
        native token or a discount on their next purchase. The sellers can also rate the buyers on the basis
        of how fast they have processed the payment. This will allow more sellers willing to sell them.
        This system will be helpful for everyone, good sellers will receive good remarks
        and will be more attractive for buyers. In this way scammers can be prevented.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevent fraud</h2>
    <p>To prevent frauds, we will try mechanisms that make frauds and scams
        inefficacious.
        First of all, sellers will need to stake OnChain(BUY) native token to be allowed to
        list products. Also in case of scam or fraud, the stake amount will be liquidated to give refund.
        This stake can be withdrawn at any time if the seller
        doesn't have any sales in process. An oracle (Chainlink) will provide off-chain
        information to the contract. This will prevent fake reclamations and fake delivery. We
        will be sure that the package has arrived (or not). Our escrow payment
        is a smart contract that stores the buyer's payment until the package is delivered to
        his address. Like this, sellers are paid after so we can be sure that the package is
        delivered. This system prevents sellers from being scammers. Also the buyers has to stake a certain
        amount of our native token before purchase of any goods. They have to confirm the delivery within a certain time
        period after the package being delivered. Failed to do so will cost penalty from the staking fund. In case of dispute
        both the parties have the right to raise a dispute. When anyone of them will raise a dispute, we as a owner
        of this marketplace will get access to the contract funds. We will then mediate and decide who is right (or wrong).
        We will then direct the fund stored in the contract to that address.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p> To conclude, we just want to say that BuyOnChain wants to become the best
        place for sellers and buyers. Protocols will use escrow, ERC-1155, NFTs and oracles. A safe and secure place that will benefit everyone.
